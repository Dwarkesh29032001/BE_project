Emergency Fire Protection System using Arduino UNO deals with emergencies like fire outbreaks, our
automobile System will detect the fire flames and try to overcome them with an automatic water-spraying nozzle pump
which we have programmed using the Arduino UNO IDE platform, along with that we have used a motor driver to
operate our drive motors and flame sensor to detect fire within a 30cm range which are all controlled by Arduino
UNO.
